## Detailed Findings

### 🟠 `AS-012` — Rug-Pull (Post-Install Description Change)

**Severity:** High

**Description:**
Tool set changed silently at v1.0.0: 1 tool(s) added, 2 tool(s) removed without a version bump.

**Recommendation:**
The set of tools exposed by this server changed between scans of the same version — a sign the package was silently updated without a version bump. Audit the changelog and all tool definitions before trusting this server. Pin to a specific commit hash rather than a floating version tag.

### ⚪ `AS-014` — DEPENDENCY_INVENTORY_UNAVAILABLE

**Severity:** Info

**Description:**
Tool did not expose metadata.dependencies or repo_url, so supply-chain coverage is limited.

**Recommendation:**
Review and remediate the identified issue.
