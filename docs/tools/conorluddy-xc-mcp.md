## Detailed Findings

### ⚪ 🔑 `AS-002` — Excessive Permission Surface

**Severity:** Info

**Description:**
declared capabilities: code/command execution, database access

**Recommendation:**
Tool requests broad permissions (exec/fs/network). Validate input parameters using Enums where possible, and restrict file system operations to explicit allowed directories.

---

### 🔵 ⚡ `AS-011` — DoS Resilience — Missing Rate Limit / Timeout

**Severity:** Low

**Description:**
tool performs network or execution operations but declares no rate-limit, timeout, or retry configuration

**Recommendation:**
Declare explicit rate-limit, timeout, and retry configuration for all network and execution tools. Implement exponential back-off and surface resource state to the calling agent.

---
