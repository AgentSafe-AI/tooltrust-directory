## Detailed Findings

### ⚪ `AS-014` — DEPENDENCY_INVENTORY_UNAVAILABLE

**Severity:** Info

**Description:**
No metadata.dependencies or repo_url were exposed by this MCP server, and no local project manifest could be inferred from the launch command.

**Recommendation:**
Review and remediate the identified issue.
