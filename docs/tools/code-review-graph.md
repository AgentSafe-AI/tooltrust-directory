## Detailed Findings

### 🟠 `AS-012` — Rug-Pull (Post-Install Description Change)

**Severity:** High

**Description:**
Tool set changed silently at vscode-v0.2.1: 1 tool(s) added, 28 tool(s) removed without a version bump.

**Recommendation:**
The set of tools exposed by this server changed between scans of the same version — a sign the package was silently updated without a version bump. Audit the changelog and all tool definitions before trusting this server. Pin to a specific commit hash rather than a floating version tag.

### 🔴 ⚡ `AS-006` — Arbitrary Code Execution

**Severity:** Critical

**Description:**
tool name or description implies arbitrary script/code execution (evaluate_script, execute javascript, etc.)

**Recommendation:**
This tool can execute arbitrary code or shell commands on the host system. Remove it unless strictly required. If kept: (1) restrict access to trusted users/agents only, (2) require human approval before each invocation (Claude Desktop: set approval_required: true; other clients: enable equivalent confirmation), (3) use the most restrictive sandbox or read-only mode available, and (4) never expose this tool to untrusted input sources.

### ⚪ `AS-014` — DEPENDENCY_INVENTORY_UNAVAILABLE

**Severity:** Info

**Description:**
Tool did not expose metadata.dependencies or repo_url, so supply-chain coverage is limited.

**Recommendation:**
Review and remediate the identified issue.
