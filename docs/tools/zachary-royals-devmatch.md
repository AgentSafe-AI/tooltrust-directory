# 🟢 zachary-royals-devmatch

> DevMatch is an MCP server for hiring engineers based on what they've actually built. Connect from Cursor, Claude Desktop, or any MCP-compatible AI assistant and search 35M+ developers ranked by verified open-source contributions — not LinkedIn keywords or self-reported skills.

 **Three tools:**

**`find_candidates`** — paste a job description, get a ranked shortlist with bio, top repos, contribution evidence, and contact info. Pro tier adds verified email enrichment on the top 5 results.
**`get_profile`** — deep-dive any GitHub handle. Bio, recent activity, top projects, and outreach channels in one call.
**`find_similar_projects`** — landscape mapping from a seed repo with top contributors surfaced, so you can pivot from a project to its maintainers in one step.

Built for mission-driven teams that want engineers who care about the work, not just check the keyword box. OAuth sign-in (no API keys to juggle). Free tier with 50 monthly credits, $129/mo Pro for higher quotas plus verified email enrichment.

## Detailed Findings

### ⚪ 🔑 `AS-002` — Excessive Permission Surface

**Severity:** Info

**Description:**
declared capabilities: network access, filesystem access

**Recommendation:**
Tool requests broad permissions (exec/fs/network). Validate input parameters using Enums where possible, and restrict file system operations to explicit allowed directories.

---

### 🔵 ⚡ `AS-011` — DoS Resilience — Missing Rate Limit / Timeout

**Severity:** Low

**Description:**
tool performs network or execution operations but declares no rate-limit, timeout, or retry configuration

**Recommendation:**
Declare explicit rate-limit, timeout, and retry configuration for all network and execution tools. Implement exponential back-off and surface resource state to the calling agent.

---

### ⚪ `AS-014` — DEPENDENCY_INVENTORY_UNAVAILABLE

**Severity:** Info

**Description:**
Tool did not expose metadata.dependencies or repo_url, so supply-chain coverage is limited.

**Recommendation:**
Review and remediate the identified issue.
