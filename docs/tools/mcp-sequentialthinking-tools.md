## Detailed Findings

### 🟠 `AS-012` — Rug-Pull (Post-Install Description Change)

**Severity:** High

**Description:**
Tool set changed silently at v0.1.1: 3 tool(s) added, 2 tool(s) removed without a version bump.

**Recommendation:**
The set of tools exposed by this server changed between scans of the same version — a sign the package was silently updated without a version bump. Audit the changelog and all tool definitions before trusting this server. Pin to a specific commit hash rather than a floating version tag.

### 🔵 🔑 `AS-002` — Excessive Permission Surface

**Severity:** Low

**Description:**
input schema exposes 13 properties (threshold: 10)

**Recommendation:**
Tool requests broad permissions (exec/fs/network). Validate input parameters using Enums where possible, and restrict file system operations to explicit allowed directories.

**Severity:** Info
