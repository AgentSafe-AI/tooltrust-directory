## Detailed Findings

### 🟠 🔑 `AS-002` — Excessive Permission Surface

**Severity:** High

**Description:**
tool declares network permission

**Recommendation:**
Restrict tool capabilities to the minimum required. Audit each declared permission (exec, network, db, fs) and remove any not strictly necessary.

---

### 🔵 ⚡ `AS-011` — DoS Resilience — Missing Rate Limit / Timeout

**Severity:** Low

**Description:**
tool performs network or execution operations but declares no rate-limit, timeout, or retry configuration

**Recommendation:**
Declare explicit rate-limit, timeout, and retry configuration for all network and execution tools. Implement exponential back-off and surface resource state to the calling agent.
