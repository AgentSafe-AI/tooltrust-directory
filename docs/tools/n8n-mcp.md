## Detailed Findings

### 🟡 ⚠️ `AS-002` — Excessive Permission Surface

**Severity:** Medium

**Description:**
tool declares fs permission

**Recommendation:**
Restrict tool capabilities to the minimum required. Audit each declared permission (exec, network, db, fs) and remove any not strictly necessary.

---

### 🟡 ⚠️ `AS-002` — Excessive Permission Surface

**Severity:** Medium

**Description:**
tool declares db permission

**Recommendation:**
Restrict tool capabilities to the minimum required. Audit each declared permission (exec, network, db, fs) and remove any not strictly necessary.
