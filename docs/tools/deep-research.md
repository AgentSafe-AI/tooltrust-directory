## Detailed Findings

### 🟠 `AS-012` — Rug-Pull (Post-Install Description Change)

**Severity:** High

**Description:**
Tool set changed silently at v0.11.0: 3 tool(s) added, 12 tool(s) removed without a version bump.

**Recommendation:**
The set of tools exposed by this server changed between scans of the same version — a sign the package was silently updated without a version bump. Audit the changelog and all tool definitions before trusting this server. Pin to a specific commit hash rather than a floating version tag.
