> Search and book real-world tours and activities via API — with confirmed execution and status tracking.

Real last-minute inventory from 11 suppliers (Arctic Adventures, Bicycle Roma, Ramen Factory Kyoto, Hillborn Experiences Tanzania, O Turista Tours, Pure Morocco, and more). 1,400+ slots within 168h, updated every 4h via OCTO open standard.

v2.1.0 (2026-04-15): reliability upgrade — fixed booking execution bug (previous versions silently failed), moved to async I/O to eliminate timeouts under concurrent agent usage. Load-tested: 100% success under burst (100/100 /slots, 60/60 MCP).

Tools:

search_slots — find available experiences by city, category, price
book_slot — initiate booking (returns approval URL or completes autonomously if wallet provided)
get_booking_status — track booking state (pending → confirmed / failed)
Use get_supplier_info first to understand coverage.

Designed for AI agents: consistent success tracking, idempotent booking, and real-world confirmation numbers.

## Detailed Findings

### 🟠 🔑 `AS-002` — Excessive Permission Surface

**Severity:** High

**Description:**
tool declares network permission

**Recommendation:**
Tool requests broad permissions (exec/fs/network). Validate input parameters using Enums where possible, and restrict file system operations to explicit allowed directories.

---

### 🔵 ⚡ `AS-011` — DoS Resilience — Missing Rate Limit / Timeout

**Severity:** Low

**Description:**
tool performs network or execution operations but declares no rate-limit, timeout, or retry configuration

**Recommendation:**
Declare explicit rate-limit, timeout, and retry configuration for all network and execution tools. Implement exponential back-off and surface resource state to the calling agent.

---

### ⚪ `AS-014` — DEPENDENCY_INVENTORY_UNAVAILABLE

**Severity:** Info

**Description:**
Tool did not expose metadata.dependencies or repo_url, so supply-chain coverage is limited.

**Recommendation:**
Review and remediate the identified issue.
